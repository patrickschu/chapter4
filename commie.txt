All of my ratings here are mere conjectures. I have no idea who wrote this but I suspect it's not authentic and just fabricated by a researcher.
At first I thought this was a question addressing the dating sites.  You see on t.v.commercials.
At first, I thought the author was a man, but most of the guys I know don't use exclamation points when writing, so I think the author might be a woman. Also, I don't really get a sense of the person's sexuality preference from the note, so that could go either way. The note actually sounds more like the author is looking for some friends in a new place than a partner, so is probably looking for both men & women to answer the ad.
Author impresses me as looking to assemble a 'group' of friends rather than just another individual.
Awesome
Could be either of them
Did not understand the Men are... Women are...
Do people really do this? 
Doesn't look to be looking for sex or anything, really seems to be just looking for some cool friends.
Enjoyable - thanks!
enjoyed the survey was engaging and interesting
Everything was fine.
Flirty.
fun task
fun!
God Bless.
Good
good luck with your research!
good survey
Good survey
Great study.
Great survey. 
great task
had to choose between heterosexual and homosexual but i could see it being either one, equally.
Had to go with some option becuase of the design of the survey. but i think there should be a "i dont have a bias " option
Have a great day!
Hey are lonely and in need of friends. Probably moved to a new city recently.
Hope I did this right.
i am guessing the writer is a woman because that was my first instinct and i see more posts like this from girls on social media than from men
I am making vague assumptions based on very little information, so some of this is just a guess. For instance, I don't really have any suspicion about race or gender from was written, I'm just giving my gut reaction.
I can tell almost nothing about the author, so I'm just guessing. I also I have no idea what you're seeking with "Men are ..." and "Women are ..."
I didn't really understand the open ended question. Thank you!
I didn't understand the last two questions (men are... women are...) so I answered them the best I could.
I don't have much to base my answers on, they are complete guesses.
I don't know what was meant by the last two questions. "Men are..." and "Women are..."
I don't understand the last two open ended questions.
I don't understand what is wanted from the last two questions. 
I enjoyed your HIT
I feel like the last two questions were a bit too open-ended, and wasn't quite sure what you were looking for; in this case, I formed my answer to sort of relate to the scenario, but they could work as general statements as well.
I felt like the author could have been any race, really- I can't help but feel I'm a white person going with that "white default" there.  I felt much more strongly about the personality characteristics of the author than outer things like that.  ...Except that it's probably a guy.  Just asking to randomly hang out with anyone available strikes me as such a guy thing to do.  And I wouldn't reply not because of anything wrong with the ad, but because I'm shy (and if I did reply, as a cautious person, I wouldn't meet them alone- I'd have to have a friend who was willing to come with me).
i guess not
I have no further comments.
I have no idea what the race/gender/sexual orientation of the author is from the ad. I had to pick an option so I just guessed.
I have seen this on message boards for my community.  It's typically a woman posting and other women respond.
I honestly don't know about any of these, except the education question. I wish there were neutral answers on the scaled questions. I chose heterosexual simply because a larger portion of the population is heterosexual. I chose white because, as a white person, that is my default guess about anyone when I don't know anything about them.
I imagine the author is a new city resident and looking to expand his cricle of friends.
i like much
I like this survey. Quite unique.
I really did not get the last two questions Men are.. and Women are. I put what I thought you wanted to hear but wasn't exactly sure. Sorry
I think he was seeking out men and women
I think the "Hi there" is what gives the ad such a feeling of being written by a gay male.  The person seems friendly enough; I can almost see him waving his hand.  Also, "Looking forward to hearing from you" also feels a bit 'gay' in this context.  
I was a little confused by the two last questions: Men are... and Women are...  but I answered as best I could. I hope you understand my harmless joke. There was a notable book some time ago with the title "Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus".
I was really grasping at straws on this one. There is no way of knowing from the few words the person wrote whether he/she is educated or attractive, etc.  Weird of you to ask, except that MTurk is all about the psychology. So not weird at all. 
I wasn't quite sure what to to write specifically men are ... women are ...

Wasn't sure what you were looking for.
I would be nervous replying to this could be anyone.  They seem a little desperate. 
I would never look for people in this manner.  Seems weird. Is it just me?
I wouldn't reply. Maybe if she shared more interesting things. She sounds boring and lame
I'm not quite sure what answers you wanted in the "Men are..." and "Women are..." sections, so I figured I'd just go scientific. 
I'm not sure what kind of response you were looking for in the two questions above?
I'm not too sure what you are asking for in the last two questions ("Men are...", "Women are..").
I'm really not sure what you wanted me to write in those two boxes: "Men are... & Women are ..." . A little more info would have been great. :)
Individuals who use "u" and "ur" make themselves seem less educated by not using "you" and "you're".

interesting survey.
Interesting survey.
Intersting
Intriguing survey.
It feels kind of sketchy in the first place. I would prefer to know the person online first than in person.
It honestly sounds like he's looking for someone to hook up with and is just phrasing it nicely. 
It is difficult to tell on a lot of those.
It is unclear if this author wants to go out with friends that is a female or a male.
It is very interesting survey.
It seems more like a personal ad on dating website.
It seems like a weird thing to post on social media.
it seems like it's a young-ish woman looking for friends.
It seems the author is writing for either a man or woman. And you were asking if he or she was heterosexual or homosexual, but he or she could be bi. You are asking below if I would respond to the ad. I would say yes, IF I was single and the author was an attractive female.
It sound like a guy just looking for some male friends.
It sounds creepy and like a scam or looking for something uncouth.  Possibly just written by someone too old to understand internet etiquette. 
It was a little bit hard to answer some questions, because some I just could not tell you from the information given. I had to guess the sexuality.
It's unclear what you are wanting with the statements 'men are' and 'women are'. 
just kidding. :)
lack of street slang and correct spelling are the best clues here
Last two questions are foolish or at the very least a waste of time without any sort of instruction or context 
LAST TWO QUESTIONS OF THE SURVEY ARE VERY OPEN ENDED....
Little vague lol
Looks like a young person wrote it-- based on the poor grammar.  
Lots of guesswork required here!
Many of these are assumptions

Not sure how to answer the gender are... questions
not sure what yo were looking for in the last two questions 
Not sure what you wanted in the above two questions so I winged it. Great ad! I hope that was written by a woman.
not sure what you were looking for in the above. 
not sure where you were going with the men/women question.  Sorry, just don't see where to go with that.
nothing thanks
please give bonus
quick and to the point :)
Regardless of my above comments about men being more likely to place an ad on social media to meet up with strangers, although I would not, for safety reasons as a women, I am sure there are many girls who may. 
Seems like a bro looking for a bro to hang out with 
She could be writing to a man or a woman.
short and simple. nice!
Some of these response choices are impossible to answer without more information. In those cases, I simply chose the option that had the largest share of the population in general.
Somewhat a confusing study.
Sounds like someone trying to get personal info from you.
Thanjs
Thank you

thanks for the study
Thanks for the study, haven't had one like this so far. 
Thanks for the survey
Thanks for the survey!!
Thanks!
Thanks!
the "Men are...." and "women are..." sections were vague and I had no idea what I was supposed to write
The author could be writing for a man or a woman with equal likelihood in my opinion but I had to choose one so I chose man 
The author is agreesive
The author is superficial and not very interesting.
The author seems like an older woman.
The details are unknown from information in text.
The language seems very fun and relatively well off. 
The last two questions were confusing.
The message sounds very "sketchy" to anyone who reads it and it made me feel uncomfortable.
The only comment I have is that you can't tell if a person is any of these options you've given based off the paragraph provided. 
the point of the previous 2 questions is what?
The text is very generic.  Could actually be used for male/female, homosexual/heterosexual, and almost any race.
the two open ended questions are very confusing, i wasn't sure what i was supposed to be answering because you didn't give me any information on how to answer it.
There are several sentence fragments, but I'm not sure if they are due to lack of education or if they are due to wanting to sound "fun".
There should be a not sure button. There isn't one way for men/women/straight/gay people to talk. The only thing you can really determine is their use of the English language.
This is interesting. 
This was great but I didn't understand the last two questions that said "Men/Women are...". Much too vague.
Ty
Very fun study!
very interesting!
What a strange survey. 
what if the guy is a weirdo
what was the purpose of this
what?!
When first reading the paragraph. I assumed it was a female looking for friends.
Who the author was writing for was a bit ambiguous. I just selected man.
Who the hell are we really?
Yes.  I felt that this could be for anyone, man or woman, straight or gay.  I really didn't feel strongly about the choices I made.
Yes. This took much longer than your suggested "3 minutes" to complete.
